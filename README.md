## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
ID is a digital identity service from Mastercard that helps you apply for, enroll in, log in to, and access services more simply, securely and privately. Rather than manually providing your information when you are trying to complete tasks online or in apps, ID enables you to share your verified information automatically, more securely, and with your consent and control. ID also enables you to do away with passwords and protects your personal information. Please see here for more details on the API: [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/mastercard-id-for-idp/documentation/).

For more information regarding the program, refer to [ID Service](https://idservice.com/)

### Integrating with OpenAPI Generator <a name="integrating-with-openapi-generator"></a>
[OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) generates API client libraries from [OpenAPI Specs](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).
It provides generators and library templates for supporting multiple languages and frameworks.

### Generating The API Client Sources <a name="generating-the-api-client-sources"></a>
Now that you have all the required dependencies, you can generate the sources. To do this, use one of the following two methods:

`Using IDE`
* **Method 1**<br/>
  In IntelliJ IDEA, open the Maven window **(View > Tool Windows > Maven)**. Click the icons `Reimport All Maven Projects` and `Generate Sources and Update Folders for All Projects`

* **Method 2**<br/>

  In the same menu, navigate to the commands **({Project name} > Lifecycle)**, select `clean` and `compile`, then click the icon `Run Maven Build`.

`Using Terminal`
* Navigate to the project's root directory within a terminal window and execute `mvn clean compile` command.

### Build the Project <a name="build-project"></a>
Once you clone the project you must ensure that IntelliJ IDEA recognizes the folders. Go to
**(file > project structure > modules)** and select the folder `src/main/java` as a source and `src/test/java` as test folder,
also check the language level at this configuration options and see if it's selected (8 - lambda type annotation etc.) following your java version
add also the Maven support in the Project tool window, right-click your project and select Add Framework Support.

### Test Case Execution <a name="test-case-execute"></a>
Navigate to the test package and right click to  `Run All Tests`

### Use cases <a name="use-cases"></a>

More details can be found [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/mastercard-id-for-idp/documentation/use-cases/).

Guides and tutorials can be found [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/mastercard-id-for-rp/documentation/tutorials-and-guides/).

### Execute the Use-Cases <a name="execute-use-cases"></a>
1. Run `mvn clean install` from the root of the project directory.
2. There are two ways to execute the user cases :
   1. Execute the test cases
        - At the `src/test/java` which is the main root folder for all Junit tests of the application.
        - Run the tests.
   2. Select the menu options provided by the application
        - Run ```mvn spring-boot:run``` command to run the application.
        - Once the application is running, you should be able to see and chose the follow three options :
          - 0 Exit
          - 1 RP Scopes
          - 2 Scope-fulfillments
          - 4 Share Insight
        - The option 1 and 2 are going to ask for the ARID value in case you press enter the ARID value used is going to be the one found at the `application.properties` file. 

## API Reference <a name="api-reference"></a>
To develop a client application that consumes the ID for Identity Providers API with Spring Boot, refer to the [ID for Identity Providers Reference](https://developer.mastercard.com/mastercard-id-for-idp/documentation/api-reference/).

### Authorization <a name="authorization"></a>
The `com.mastercard.dis.mids.reference.config` package will provide you API client. This class will take care of adding the correct `Authorization` header before sending the request.

### Request Examples <a name="request-examples"></a>
You can change the default input passed to APIs, modifying values in the following file: `com.mastercard.dis.mids.reference.constants.Constants`

### Client Encryption <a name="client-encryption"></a>
The public key your application uses to encrypt requests is listed under “Client Encryption Keys” on the Developer Dashboard.
this key file is linked at the [application.properties](./src/main/resources/application.properties).
for more information please go to [Payload Encryption](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/).
We also recommend reading Using Payload Encryption link at the References section at this document.

### Recommendation <a name="recommendation"></a>
It is recommended to create an instance of `ApiClient` per thread in a multithreaded environment to avoid any potential issues.
